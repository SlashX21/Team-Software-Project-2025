# GitHub and Team Management

## GitHub

### Version Control and Collaboration Strategy

The team will adopt GitHub as the core version control and collaboration platform, with the project repository located at https://github.com/SlashX21/Team-Software-Project-2025. Considering the team scale and project complexity, we have established a comprehensive branching management strategy to ensure a balance between code quality and development efficiency:

- **Main Branch Management**: Main branch reserved for stable production code with mandatory testing and code review
- **Feature Branch Development**: Parallel development through independent feature branches, merged via Pull Requests
- **Commit Standards**: Regular, meaningful commits from all members including code, documentation, meeting minutes, and design materials

### Project Documentation and History Management

To ensure project traceability and centralized information management, the team has established a complete documentation management system. We recognize that in software development processes, documentation is as important as code itself, therefore all project-related content is uniformly managed through GitHub:

- Establish dedicated **Project Plan folder** for version control of planning documents and core documentation
- Maintain **COMMIT_LOG.md** for detailed milestone and change history tracking
- Unified GitHub management for meeting minutes, technical documents, and user feedback ensuring transparency

Through this systematic management approach, the team can not only effectively track project progress but also provide complete and structured development history records for subsequent evaluation, improvement, and knowledge transfer.

## Team Management

### Meeting System and Communication Mechanisms

The team recognizes that effective communication is a key factor in project success, therefore we have established a multi-layered, systematic communication and collaboration system. Our meeting management system emphasizes effective information transmission, democratic participation in decision-making, and timely follow-up execution:

- **Regular Meeting Schedule**: Weekly Sunday meetings for progress synchronization, first meeting held June 1, 2025, next scheduled June 6
- **Meeting Process Optimization**: Structured processes with preset agendas, real-time discussions, and clear follow-up actions
- **Standardized Meeting Records**: Formal DOCX records documenting agendas, discussions, decisions, and action items
- **Convenient Daily Communication**: Discord platform for rapid communication, document sharing, and immediate coordination

### Project Management and Task Tracking

Considering the project's complexity and team collaboration needs, we have selected Monday.com as the primary task management and progress tracking platform, implementing scientific and visual project management methods:

- **Task System Development**: Project decomposed into executable tasks with assigned responsibilities, deadlines, and completion standards
- **Dependency Relationship Management**: Logical task dependencies established to optimize workflow and avoid bottlenecks
- **Agile Development Practices**: Sprint management with 2-3 day cycles for the current Project Plan phase
- **Visual Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking and workload monitoring through Monday.com timeline features

This multi-dimensional, tool-based management mechanism not only ensures timely information transmission and rapid problem identification and resolution, but also establishes standardized collaboration patterns for the team, laying a solid organizational and management foundation for successful project delivery.
