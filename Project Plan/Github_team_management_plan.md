# GitHub and Team Management

## GitHub

### Version Control and Collaboration Strategy

The team will adopt GitHub as the core version control and collaboration platform, with the project repository located at https://github.com/SlashX21/Team-Software-Project-2025. Considering the team scale and project complexity, we have established a comprehensive branching management strategy to ensure a balance between code quality and development efficiency:

- **Main Branch Management**: The main branch is strictly reserved for stable production code, ensuring deployment readiness at all times. All code merged into the main branch must undergo thorough testing and code review
- **Feature Branch Development**: Each member conducts parallel development through independent feature branches to avoid code conflicts, merging to the main branch via Pull Requests after completing development and testing
- **Commit Standards**: Establish regular and meaningful commit mechanisms, requiring all team members to maintain active contribution records. Commit content encompasses code development, documentation updates, meeting minutes, design diagrams, and other types of contributions, ensuring project comprehensiveness and continuity

### Project Documentation and History Management

To ensure project traceability and centralized information management, the team has established a complete documentation management system. We recognize that in software development processes, documentation is as important as code itself, therefore all project-related content is uniformly managed through GitHub:

- Establish a dedicated **Project Plan folder** for version control of project planning documents, including requirements analysis, technical solutions, progress schedules, and other core documentation
- Maintain **COMMIT_LOG.md** to record important development milestones and change history in detail, providing a basis for project reviews and issue tracking
- Meeting minutes, technical design documents, user feedback, and other materials are all managed through GitHub for unified version control and team sharing, ensuring information transparency and consistency

Through this systematic management approach, the team can not only effectively track project progress but also provide complete and structured development history records for subsequent evaluation, improvement, and knowledge transfer.

## Team Management

### Meeting System and Communication Mechanisms

The team recognizes that effective communication is a key factor in project success, therefore we have established a multi-layered, systematic communication and collaboration system. Our meeting management system emphasizes effective information transmission, democratic participation in decision-making, and timely follow-up execution:

- **Regular Meeting Schedule**: Establish every Sunday as the fixed team meeting day, ensuring team members can regularly synchronize project progress. The first formal meeting was successfully held on June 1, 2025, establishing a solid foundation for collaboration, with the next meeting scheduled for June 6
- **Meeting Process Optimization**: Adopt structured meeting processes, including preset detailed agendas, open real-time discussions, and clear follow-up actions. Each meeting sets specific goals and expected outputs to improve meeting efficiency
- **Standardized Meeting Records**: Each meeting produces formal records in DOCX format, detailing agenda execution, key discussion points, team decisions, and specific action items, ensuring all members have clear understanding of project direction and individual responsibilities
- **Convenient Daily Communication**: Establish Discord platform as the daily rapid communication channel, with dedicated project channels supporting document sharing, problem discussion, and immediate coordination, supplementing formal meetings

### Project Management and Task Tracking

Considering the project's complexity and team collaboration needs, we have selected Monday.com as the primary task management and progress tracking platform, implementing scientific and visual project management methods:

- **Task System Development**: Scientifically decompose the entire project into specific, executable task units, with each task clearly assigned to responsible individuals, reasonable deadlines, and completion standards, ensuring work operability and assessability
- **Dependency Relationship Management**: In-depth analysis and establishment of logical dependencies between tasks, optimizing workflow rationality, avoiding resource conflicts and progress bottlenecks, improving overall development efficiency
- **Agile Development Practices**: Adopt Sprint management mode, advancing the project in phases. The current Project Plan phase is set for a compact 2-3 day completion cycle, ensuring rapid response and continuous improvement through short-cycle iterations
- **Visual Progress Monitoring**: Fully utilize Monday.com's timeline and status tracking features to monitor overall project progress and team member workload distribution in real-time, providing data support for resource allocation and risk management

This multi-dimensional, tool-based management mechanism not only ensures timely information transmission and rapid problem identification and resolution, but also establishes standardized collaboration patterns for the team, laying a solid organizational and management foundation for successful project delivery.
