## Grocery Guardian: AI Grocery Assistant

#### Project Objectives

Grocery Guardian is a practical tool designed to help users identify allergens in grocery and cosmetic products. Many people find it hard to understand ingredient lists, especially when allergens are hidden under unfamiliar names. This can lead to health risks and poor purchasing decisions. Users also lack easy ways to track their grocery habits or monitor things like sugar intake.

Our goal is to create a simple and effective system where users can scan a product barcode to see its ingredients, get alerts if allergens are present, and receive suggestions for safer alternatives. Users can also upload receipts to keep track of what theyâ€™ve bought and review their nutrition trends over time.

The app allows users to set their dietary restrictions, such as specific allergens or sugar limits, so that feedback and suggestions are personalized. We also plan to explore a reward feature using blockchain to encourage users to buy more sustainable or healthier products.

By combining barcode scanning, ingredient analysis, receipt tracking, and user preferences, this project aims to help people make safer and smarter decisions when shopping.
