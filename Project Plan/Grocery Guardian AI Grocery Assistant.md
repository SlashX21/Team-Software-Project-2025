## Grocery Guardian: AI Grocery Assistant

#### Project Objectives

Grocery Guardian is a practical tool designed to help users identify allergens in grocery and cosmetic products. Many people find it hard to understand ingredient lists, especially when allergens are hidden under unfamiliar names. This can lead to health risks and poor purchasing decisions. Users also lack easy ways to track their grocery habits or monitor things like sugar intake.

Our goal is to create a simple system where users can scan a product barcode to see its ingredients, get alerts if allergens are present, and receive safer alternative suggestions. Users can also upload receipts to track what they’ve bought and review nutrition trends over time.

Technically, the system will use Azure’s Computer Vision API for barcode and receipt image processing, and Natural Language Processing to analyze ingredient text and detect allergens. A lightweight backend will handle data matching and user profiles. We plan to use a small database of common products and ingredients, and optionally implement a blockchain-based point system to reward sustainable purchases.

By combining computer vision, NLP, and cloud-based processing, this project aims to support safer and more informed shopping for people with allergies or specific dietary needs.
